# odin-recipes

The goal of this project is to build a webpage featuring three unique recipes. Each recipe will be accessible via its own link from the homepage and should include the following elements: a title, a photo, a brief description, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps. Atomic commits are required when committing to Git throughout the development process.
